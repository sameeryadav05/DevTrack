# 🚀 DevTrack — Custom Version Control System

> A full-stack version control system inspired by Git, designed for developers who want full control over their projects — both from the **Web UI** and **CLI**.  
> Built using **Node.js**, **Express**, **MongoDB**, **React**, **Yargs**, and **Sass**, DevTrack delivers seamless version tracking, commit management, and secure cloud storage.

## 🌟 Features

✅ **Dual Interface Support** — Use DevTrack through both a modern web dashboard and a CLI interface.  
✅ **Git-like Commands** — Supports essential Git workflows including:
- `init` → Initialize a repository  
- `add` → Stage files for commit  
- `commit` → Save snapshots  
- `push` / `pull` → Sync with remote storage  
- `log` → View commit history  

✅ **Cloud Storage Integration** — Connected with **Supabase Bucket Storage** for secure, scalable, cloud-based file management.  
✅ **Version Tracking** — Efficiently tracks file changes and collaboration history.  
✅ **Modern UI** — Responsive design built with **React** + **Sass**, offering a smooth developer experience.
